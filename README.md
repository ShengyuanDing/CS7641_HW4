This file is to explore using policy iteration and value iteration algorithm and one of my favorite reinforcement learning algorith q-learning to solve two
MDPs: Forest Management Problem and Frozen Lake Problem. 

In this file, different algorithms were used to solve Forest Management Problem and Frozen Lake Problem and their performance were compared.
applied to the Breast Cancer dataset and the Neural Network learner was rerun on the
